# tasks-rule
A study of the role of tasks in shaping visual processing


# Tasks studied:
- Task 1 : Single-class classification task [link](https://github.com/hamzakeurti/tasks-rule/blob/master/data/single-class-classification-dataset.pkl).
  - Images are from MS-COCO.
  - There are 50,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set.
  - Pickle file organization structure: [training set, test_set], training set = [image id list, label list], test set = [image id list, label list].

# fMRI data:
The [BOLD5000](https://bold5000.github.io/) dataset: fMRI responses of 4 subjects to 5254 images taken from COCO (2000 images), ImageNet (1916 images) and scene images (1000).
